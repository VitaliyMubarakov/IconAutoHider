Please note that the application is still in development, and certain features may need refinement.

In the future, I aim to add more customization options, such as automatic icon arrangement based on screen size, but this might take some time due to technical limitations.

## Features
- Automatically hide desktop icons
- Full compatibility with **Wallpaper Engine**
- Customize settings via a configuration file
- Lightweight and easy-to-use

## Installation
- Download and unpack the archive.
- Run the IconHider.exe file.
- You can run the IconHiderAddStartup.bat file. This will automatically configure the application to launch on startup every time you log into your system.
